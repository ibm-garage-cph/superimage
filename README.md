# superimage

Essentially your cloud-native sandbox environment

This docker image comes pre-packed with: docker (you heard right), ibmcloud cli, kubectl, helmctl, tekton & openshift

Use in situations when you can't install any of these tools locally, but you have access to an openshift cluster via the browser.
